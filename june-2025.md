# 🌟 Stellar Cherotich – Monthly Worklog (June 2025)

## ✅ 1. Summary of What I Worked On
- Built a **To-Do List Web App** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Integrated **Local Storage** to persist tasks across sessions.
- Practiced **DOM manipulation** and **JavaScript event handling**.
- Improved Git workflow: cloning, committing, pushing to GitHub.

---

## 🏆 2. Achievements
- ✅ Created a functional and user-friendly **To-Do List App**.
- ✅ Used `localStorage` to ensure tasks remain after refreshing.
- ✅ Structured my JavaScript using clean, modular functions.
- ✅ Mastered key Git/GitHub operations for version control.

## 🧠 3. Learnings from Failures or Challenges
- 💡 Initially pushed to a GitHub repo without initializing locally — learned to use `git init` and set upstream properly.
- ⚠️ Faced a bug where `addTask()` triggered unintentionally — resolved by controlling event flow and understanding `DOMContentLoaded`.
- 🐞 Encountered storage bugs — fixed by properly serializing/deserializing task data using `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse()`.

---

## ✨ 4. Monthly Highlights
- 🌈 Felt empowered after completing my first **real web project**.
- 🚀 Watched my To-Do List persist across sessions — felt like magic!
- 🔥 Gained confidence in **frontend basics** and Git usage.
- 👩🏽‍💻 Ready to take on my next challenge: **Simple Quiz App UI** & **Amazi Water Delivery Project**.

## 📌 Platform Chosen
I will publish this log on **GitHub** (as `june-2025.md`) in my **ALX_Simple_Quiz** repo.  
Optional: Cross-post on **Notion** for personal reflection.
